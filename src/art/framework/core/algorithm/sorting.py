            The original partition scheme described by Tony Hoare uses two pointers (indices into the range)
            that start at both ends of the array being partitioned, then move toward each other, until they detect
            an inversion: a pair of elements, one greater than the bound (Hoare's terms for the pivot value)
            at the first pointer, and one less than the bound at the second pointer; if at this point
            the first pointer is still before the second, these elements are in the wrong order relative
            to each other, and they are then exchanged.[15] After this the pointers are moved inwards,
            and the search for an inversion is repeated; when eventually the pointers cross
            (the first points after the second), no exchange is performed; a valid partition is found,
            with the point of division between the crossed pointers (any entries that might be strictly
            between the crossed pointers are equal to the pivot and can be excluded from both sub-ranges formed).
            With this formulation it is possible that one sub-range turns out to be the whole original range,
            which would prevent the algorithm from advancing.
